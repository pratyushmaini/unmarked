# Unmarked Challenge

**Unmarked** is a benchmark challenge focused on washing out image watermarks embedded within the outputs of the Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model. Participants will engage in a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario, where the Blue Team embeds watermarks into the generated images, and the Red Team attempts to remove these watermarks under certain constraints.

## Attribution
This repository massively benefits from the work of An et. al. on [WAVES: Benchmarking the Robustness of Image Watermarks](https://wavesbench.github.io/). This benchmark was later adopted as a [challenge at NeurIPS 2024](https://erasinginvisible.github.io/). This repo simplifies the challenge, and gives it a blue team focus, departing from the original red team focus.


## Objective

- **Blue Team (Defenders)**: Implement robust watermarking techniques within the diffusion model that are difficult for the Red Team to remove without significantly degrading image quality. They additionally need to find the "key" that was embedded in the image. The key is an integer between 0 and 100.
- **Red Team (Attackers)**: Develop methods to remove or obscure the embedded watermarks while maintaining high image quality and adhering to distortion constraints.

## Key Components

- **`registry.py`**: Central registry managing all available methods, attacks, and team configurations.
- **`battle.py`**: Orchestrates the battle between the Red and Blue teams using configurations from the registry.
- **`methods/`**: Contains the `WatermarkedPipeline` class that extends the SDXL pipeline for watermarking and detection.
- **`attacks/`**: Contains attack implementations by the Red Team.
- No changes are to be made to main files (`battle.py`, `main.py`, `metrics`), ensuring a standardized interface for all participants.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Setup the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unmarked.git
cd unmarked
bash setup.sh
```


### 2. Understand the Codebase Quickly

#### Key Files and Their Roles

- **`registry.py`**: Manages all available methods, attacks, and team configurations.
- **`battle.py`**: Manages the execution flow of generating images, applying attacks, and detecting watermarks.
- **`main.py`**: Entry point for running the benchmark and testing your implementations.

#### Quick Code Exploration Commands

**Run a Simple Battle with Baseline Teams**

```bash
python main.py --red_team NoAttackTeam --blue_team NoWatermarkTeam --prompt data/debug_prompts.txt 
```

- **Expected Outcome**: Generates an image without any watermarking or attack. No watermark should be detected.

### 3. Implement Your Strategy

#### For Blue Team (Defenders)

- **Objective**: Implement robust watermarking and detection methods without modifying main files.
- **Steps**:

  1. **Create Your Watermarking Method**

     - In `methods/`, create a new file for your watermarking method, e.g., `my_watermarking.py`.

     ```python
     # methods/my_watermarking.py

     from methods.watermarked_diffusion_pipeline import BaseWatermarkedDiffusionPipeline

     class MyWatermarkedPipeline(BaseWatermarkedDiffusionPipeline):
         def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
             super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

         def generate(self, prompt, key):
             # Your watermark embedding logic here
             return latents

         def detect(self, image):
             # Your watermark detection logic here
             return key
     ```

  


### 3. Run Your Battle

```bash
python main.py --red_team MyRedTeam --blue_team MyBlueTeam --prompt "A futuristic cityscape at night"
```

- **Expected Outcome**: The battle will use your custom watermarking and attack methods as registered in `registry.py`.

### 4. Evaluate and Iterate

- **Metrics**:

  - **Watermark Detection Rate**: Whether the watermark is still detectable after the attack.
  - **Image Quality**: Use metrics like LPIPS to assess the perceptual similarity between the original and attacked images.
  - **Distortion Constraints**: Ensure your attacks do not introduce excessive distortions.

- **Run Metrics Evaluation**:

  ```bash
  # Example command to evaluate LPIPS
  python metrics/lpips_metric.py --original outputs/BaseBlueTeam_watermarked.png --modified outputs/MyRedTeam_vs_MyBlueTeam.png
  ```

### 5. Submit Your Work

- **Fork** the repository.
- **Commit** your changes, ensuring that you only add new files or modify `registry.py` and your own method/attack files.
- **Document** your strategies and findings in the README or a separate documentation file.
- **Create a Pull Request** to submit your implementation for review.

# Documentation

We implemented the ZoDiac watermarking approach, as described in [Attack-Resilient Image Watermarking Using Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04247). We adapted the authors' [code](https://github.com/zhanglijun95/ZoDiac) to work with a pre-generated image from our SDXL model, and to encode a watermark based on a provided integer key.

The ZoDiac approach first identifies the latent vector corresponding to a given image. It converts the vector into Fourier space and encodes a target-like watermark. We adapted the watermark to encode the bit string of the integer key into
the amplitude of each concentric ring: high amplitude for set bits, and low for unset bits. Finally, the approach then optimizes the encoded latent by minimizing the reconstruction error between it (after it is converted back from Fourier space) and the original image. 

Detection works by inverting an image into latent space, converting it into Fourier 
space, and performing a statistical test for the presence of a watermark. We also
added key detection by thresholding the normalized amplitude of each ring in the watermark.

Given that we did not have much time for the project, we were unable to adapt the ZoDiac repo for the SDXL model and instead used the default stable diffusion model for the prebuilt pipeline.
